  title: "Tactics: General Gorn",
  description: "General Gorn's tactics are as stubborn and straightforward as he is. He plants his feet and dares the enemy to move him. He is the ultimate defensive fighter, a perfect counter to any creature that relies on charging, bull rushing, or overwhelming physical force.",

    {
      title: "The Unbreakable Stance",
      content: [
        "Gorn's first action in combat is to enter his 'Stance of the Unmoving Mountain'. This grants him Regeneration 20 and makes him immune to all teleportation and planar travel effects, locking him onto the battlefield.",
        "His 'Unmovable' quality means he cannot be bull rushed, tripped, or overrun. He is a literal anchor for his army's battle line.",
        "He will position himself in a chokepoint or in front of a high-value target and simply refuse to be moved.",
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "The Charger's Nightmare",
      content: [
        "Gorn is designed to destroy chargers. When a creature charges him, he gets an attack of opportunity from 'Hold the Line' as they enter his reach.",
        "He will then use his immediate action to initiate the 'Counter Charge' maneuver from the Setting Sun discipline. This completely negates the enemy's charge, stopping them in their tracks and dealing damage.",
        "A charging creature trying to attack Gorn will find itself stopped, damaged, and standing right in front of one of the deadliest melee combatants in the world.",
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "The Grinding Counter-Offensive",
      content: [
        "Once the enemy's initial assault is broken against his defenses, Gorn goes on the offensive.",
        "He is a master of Stone Dragon maneuvers. He will use 'Mountain Tombstone Strike' to encase a powerful foe in stone, or 'Earthshaker Strike' to knock an entire group of enemies prone.",
        "His regeneration and high DR/Hardness mean he can absorb incredible amounts of punishment. He will methodically dismantle his opponents with full attacks, secure in his own invulnerability.",
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Synergies & Weaknesses",
      content: [
        "Synergies: Gorn is the perfect anchor for any army. He creates an unbreakable point around which more mobile troops can maneuver. He works well with ranged attackers who can pick off enemies that are trying to get around him.",
        "Weaknesses: His primary weakness is his lack of mobility. While he cannot be moved against his will, he is not fast. A highly mobile party can simply ignore him and go for his back line. Spells that don't allow SR and target his Will save are also a threat, though his saves are very high."
