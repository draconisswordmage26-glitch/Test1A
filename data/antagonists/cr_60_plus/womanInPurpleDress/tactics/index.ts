  description: "Yukariko does not engage in 'combat' as mortals understand it. She is a narrative force, a walking plot device whose actions are whimsical, inscrutable, and absolute. Running her is less about tracking hit points and more about describing the surreal and reality-bending consequences of her boredom or curiosity. She should never be a simple brute force encounter; she is the ultimate puzzle.",

      title: "The Opening Move: A Whimsical Test",
      content: [
        "Yukariko will never initiate hostilities directly. She will appear, observe, and test the heroes with a strange, seemingly nonsensical act.",
        "Example: She might manipulate the 'boundary of gravity' in a small area, causing the party's fighter to float helplessly into the air. She is not attacking; she is curious to see how they solve the puzzle.",
        "She will communicate through riddles and paradoxes, her immense intellect and non-linear perception of time making her conversation baffling but profound.",

    },
    {
      title: "The Counter: Effortless Negation",
      content: [
        "Direct attacks against Yukariko are likely futile. She can use her 'Gaps' to redirect a warrior's charge back at their own party, or open the 'boundary between a spell and its caster' to make a wizard's fireball explode in their face.",
        "She will treat attacks with a lazy, bored disinterest. A god-slaying arrow might be caught by a Gap that opens in front of her, which then deposits the arrow harmlessly into a teacup she is holding.",
        "Her defense is absolute because she can redefine what an 'attack' is. The only way to 'fight' her is to engage with her on her own terms: through intellect, creativity, and solving her puzzles."

      title: "The Final Act: The Story's End",
      content: [
        "If the party truly angers her or proves to be a threat to a concept she values (like the stability of her home reality's barrier), she will end the encounter instantly and without malice.",
        "She will use her Manipulation of Boundaries to achieve this. She might declare 'The boundary between this moment and the moment you decided not to bother me is now gone,' teleporting the party back in time to before they met her, with only a vague sense of déjà vu.",
        "Alternatively, for a truly hostile party, she might declare 'The boundary between you and non-existence is now open.' This is a DC 80 Fortitude save or be erased from reality. There is no spectacle; the target simply ceases to have ever been.",
        "She can also summon her Shikigami, Ran and Chen, to handle physical threats. They are her primary means of interacting with the world on a physical level and are incredibly powerful in their own right."
