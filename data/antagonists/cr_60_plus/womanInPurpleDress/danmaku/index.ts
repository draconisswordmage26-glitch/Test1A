        name: "Boundary Sign \"Boundary of Life and Death\"",
        description: "Yukariko creates a linear boundary across the battlefield. On one side, all creatures are affected by a maximized 'Wail of the Banshee' (DC 80 Fortitude or die). On the other side, all creatures are affected by a maximized 'Mass Heal' (healing 250 HP). The boundary then rapidly oscillates, forcing all creatures to make a DC 80 Reflex save each round for 5 rounds to jump to the correct side or suffer the consequences."
    },
    {
        name: "Barrier \"Mesh of Light and Darkness\"",
        description: "A lattice of light and shadow fills a 1-mile cube. The light beams are concentrated 'Sunbursts' (25d6 damage, DC 80 Reflex for half). The shadow beams are streams of negative energy that bestow 2d4 negative levels (DC 80 Fortitude for half). The pattern is mathematically complex but predictable, allowing creatures with an Intelligence of 50 or higher to navigate it safely."
    },
    {
        name: "Uncanny Sign \"Danmaku Barrier\"",
        description: "Yukariko creates a sphere of interlocking Gaps around herself. For 1d4 rounds, any attack, spell, or effect targeting her is absorbed by a Gap and redirected at a random creature (friend or foe) within 10 miles. This redirection ignores all defenses, including miss chance and Spell Resistance."
    },
    {
        name: "Boundary \"Quadruple Barrier\"",
        description: "Yukariko creates four concentric, shimmering barriers around a target area up to 1 mile in radius. Each barrier has a different, paradoxical property (e.g., 'The barrier that only reflects living things,' 'The barrier that is both here and a thousand years in the future'). Breaching the barriers requires solving a complex, conceptual puzzle rather than dealing damage."
    },
    {
        name: "\"Boundary of Body and Mind\"",
        description: "Yukariko targets a single creature, attempting to sever the connection between its physical form and its consciousness. The target must make a DC 90 Will save. On a failure, the creature's soul is ejected from its body, becoming a helpless, incorporeal observer, while its body becomes a mindless automaton under Yukariko's control."
    },
    {
        name: "Fantasy \"Maniacal Flying Object\"",
        description: "Yukariko opens a Gap to a forgotten railway line and summons an ethereal, ghostly train. The train charges across the battlefield at impossible speeds, forcing a DC 75 Reflex save for all in its path. Those who fail are struck for 50d100 force damage and are 'run over by a train,' a conceptual state that leaves them permanently shaken and unable to use vehicles."
    },
    {
        name: "Abandoned Line \"Aiming at the Abandoned Station in the Netherworld\"",
        description: "A variant of her train attack. This attack summons a train from the Netherworld, filled with the ghosts of the departed. In addition to the force damage, all creatures struck are targeted by a 'Trap the Soul' effect (DC 85 Will save) as the ghosts attempt to drag them aboard for the final journey."
