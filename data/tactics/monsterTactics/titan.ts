The `Dire Charge` epic feat is a critical addition at this stage, allowing the Titan to deliver a full attack with its warhammer at the end of a charge, massively increasing its damage potential and mobility.",

It enters its Supreme Frenzy as a free action, gaining a massive +8 bonus to Strength. It then uses a charge to close with its target and makes a single, devastating Power Attack with its warhammer, aiming to sunder the foe's weapon or armor after the initial blow.",
                "Primordial Avalanche (Epic Levels): With the `Dire Charge` feat, the Titan can move and make a full attack with its warhammer. This is a game-changing ability. It can now charge across the battlefield and unleash its full iterative attack sequence (+76/+71/+66/+61 at level 30), with each blow enhanced by Power Attack and its Frenzy/Rage. This is the ultimate expression of its power, a relentless avalanche of blows that can pulverize even the most durable epic foes in a single, thunderous charge."
