    description: "The Verdant Prince is the sentient will of the wilds, a being of rampant, chaotic life. His tactics should focus on battlefield control, turning the environment into a weapon. He is a powerful spellcaster and a surprisingly tough melee combatant, whose greatest strength is his ability to regenerate from almost any wound. He fights with the tragic fury of a man who sacrificed his humanity to save a world he can no longer be part of.",

His regeneration makes him almost impossible to kill in a battle of attrition like this."
