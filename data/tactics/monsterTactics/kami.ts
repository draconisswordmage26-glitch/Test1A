    description: "The Kami is the living spirit of a river, and its tactics should reflect the nature of water: patient, powerful, and adaptable. It is a potent spellcaster and battlefield controller, using its domain to protect life and crush those who would defile the natural world. As a benevolent guardian, it seeks to subdue and teach rather than kill, but it can become a devastating flood when angered.",

                "With the enemies bogged down, it uses a quickened 'Summon Nature's Ally' to call forth a host of aquatic creatures to attack from the water. Its main action is to cast the 'Tsunami' spell. This sends a massive wave crashing over the battlefield, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage per caster level (e.g., 20d6 at level 20) and washing away anyone who fails a Fortitude save.",
                "The Kami itself is unharmed, either using its Wild Shape to become a creature immune to the effect or simply riding the crest of the wave it created. This move can wipe out an entire army that is foolish enough to fight it on its home turf."
