    description: "The Aelder is a psionic powerhouse from a reality with different laws of physics. Its tactics should reflect its alien but noble nature. It doesn't fight like a mortal; it reshapes the battlefield, creates impossible servants, and touches the minds of its foes to understand them. Its goal is rarely to kill, but to disable, study, and learn, using its immense power to aid its heroic allies.",

The Aelder should use this not to kill, but to 'correct' creatures it deems flawed, turning a raging barbarian into a pacifist or a greedy king into a philanthropist.",

It should be played as a true cosmic being, its actions dictated by a logic that mortals can barely comprehend. Its goal is not victory, but the pursuit of some grand, alien experiment."

              "The Aelder does not defeat its foes; it proves them logically inconsistent and removes them from the equation. Its ultimate combo begins with a Quicken Power'd 'Time Hop' to send the party's main damage dealer a few rounds into the future, removing them from the immediate fight. It then manifests 'Quintessence', creating a permanent, 10-foot-thick wall of indestructible matter to divide the remaining party members.",
              "With the battlefield now controlled, it uses its standard action to trap the most powerful remaining foe in a 'Mindscape Prison' (Will save negates). While that foe is trapped in a psychic demiplane, the Aelder can focus on the remaining opponents with its Astral Constructs and lesser powers.",
              "Example (Level 20 Nexus of Creation): Against a party of four, it first uses an immediate action to manifest a defensive power like 'Inertial Barrier'. On its turn, it Quickens 'Time Hop' on the fighter. It then manifests 'Quintessence' to create a wall between the cleric and the rogue. Finally, it uses its standard action to manifest 'Mindscape Prison' on the cleric. In one round, it has potentially removed three out of four party members from the fight without dealing a single point of damage."
