    description: "The Dream Larva is a psionic god-in-the-making, a being of immense creative potential. It does not fight in a conventional sense; it reshapes reality to suit its joyful, if alien, curiosity. Its tactics should be creative and non-lethal, focused on controlling the battlefield, studying its 'opponents', and using its immense power to build rather than destroy.",

                "The God of Dreams is a true deity. Its 'Dream Apocalypse' can permanently reshape a part of the world into its personal paradise. It should be played as a benevolent but utterly alien creator, whose goals are beyond mortal comprehension. It doesn't fight enemies; it 'teaches' them, reshaping their minds and the world around them to fit its vision of a perfect, beautiful dream."

                "The Larva begins by using a quickened 'Mind Thrust' on the enemy with the weakest Will save, likely a fighter or barbarian, to deal some initial damage and test their defenses. Its main action is to manifest 'Microcosm' on the same target. If the target fails their Will save, their mind is trapped in a dream world, and their body collapses, effectively removing them from the fight.",
                "With one enemy down, it can then focus its powerful telepathy, like 'Dominate, Psionic' or 'Mind Seed', on the remaining foes, turning them against each other while its Astral Construct engages any who resist.",
                "Example (Level 20 Architect): The Larva faces a party. It uses a Quicken Power'd 'Ego Whip' on the barbarian, dealing 4d4 Charisma damage and penalizing their saves. It then manifests 'Microcosm' (Will DC 32 with its high stats). The barbarian, with their high health but low Will save and now penalized by Ego Whip, is very likely to fail and be removed from the fight. The Larva can then repeat this process on the next-weakest-willed enemy."
