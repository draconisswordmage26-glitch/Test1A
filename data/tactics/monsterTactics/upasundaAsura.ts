    description: "The Upasunda Asura is a multi-limbed terror that combines a flurry of natural attacks with the versatile, supernatural abilities granted by the spirits it binds. Its tactics should be adaptable and surprising, using its bound vestiges to produce the perfect tool to exploit its enemies' weaknesses. As a cosmic revolutionary, it fights with cold, logical precision to unmake a flawed reality.",

                "The Asura's main physical advantage is its six attacks on a full attack (four claws, two bites), which it can deliver on a charge thanks to Pounce. This makes it a devastating skirmisher.",
                "As a Binder, its true strength lies in its versatility. At the start of the day, it binds vestiges that grant it a suite of supernatural and spell-like abilities. A smart Asura will bind vestiges that counter its expected foes.",
                "Its Fast Healing and Damage Reduction make it very resilient. It can afford to take risks, knowing it can regenerate the damage.",
                "Its high saves and Spell Resistance make it a tough target for enemy spellcasters."

                "At this stage, the Asura should bind Amon for extra fire damage and a powerful ram attack on a charge. Paimon is another excellent choice for its skill bonuses and sonic blast.",
                "The strategy is simple: Pounce on the most dangerous enemy and unload a full attack. The sheer number of attacks, augmented by Amon's fire, can overwhelm most defenses.",
                "Its high Bluff and Diplomacy skills should be used to gain an advantage before combat begins, perhaps by tricking the party into splitting up."

                "A good tactic is to summon a host of creatures with Zceryll, then teleport into the enemy's back line to assassinate their spellcaster while the summons engage the front line."

                "Its 'Channel Ascendant' ability can replicate the power of a dead god, allowing it to sunder reality or speak a word of creation. This should be used to counter the most powerful epic magic of its foes.",
                "The Nexus of Dead Gods has become a living vessel for forgotten deities. Its 'Final Word' can erase a creature from existence. It should be played as a being of immense, borrowed power, whose goal of resetting the universe is now terrifyingly within its grasp. It fights with the combined might of a pantheon of dead gods."

                "The Six-Armed Pounce: This is the Asura's signature opening move, leveraging its Pounce ability to devastating effect. It charges a high-priority target, typically a spellcaster or healer. Thanks to Pounce, it can make a full attack at the end of the charge. This consists of four claw attacks and two bite attacks. With its high Strength and Multiattack feats, this is a terrifying volley of strikes. This physical assault can be augmented by its bound vestiges. For example, if it has bound Amon, each of its six attacks will also deal bonus fire damage, adding up to a massive amount of extra energy damage in a single charge.",
                "Example (Level 10 Pact-Keeper with Amon bound): The Asura charges a wizard. It makes six attacks (+27 for claws, +25 for bites) at the end of the charge. Each hit deals its normal damage (1d6+9 or 1d8+4) plus Amon's bonus fire damage (e.g., 2d6 fire if 2 essentia is invested). If all six attacks hit, that's an extra 12d6 fire damage on top of the physical damage, likely enough to kill any arcane spellcaster outright."
