    description: "The Kitsune is a spellcasting-focused controller and storyteller. Her tactics should rarely involve direct confrontation. Instead, she should use her superior magic, deceptions, and mobility to manipulate the battlefield, test the hearts of her opponents, and guide heroes with grace and cunning. As a heroic storyteller, she uses her illusions to teach and inspire, rather than to harm.",

                "The Kitsune is a master of four disciplines: arcane magic (Wizard), divine magic (Archivist), roguish skills, and bardic music. Her Fochlucan Lyrist and other prestige classes advance all of these simultaneously, making her a true 'gish' of unparalleled versatility.",
                "Her spell lists are her primary weapon. She has access to the best arcane and divine spells in the game. Her high Intelligence and Charisma give her spell DCs that are nearly impossible to resist.",
                "Change Shape is her greatest defense. She should rarely be in her true form, preferring to act through proxies or under the guise of a trusted ally. Her high Bluff and Disguise skills make her deceptions nearly perfect.",
                "Don't forget her other abilities! Sneak Attack can be devastating when delivered via a touch spell. Bardic Music can provide powerful buffs to her allies (or herself)."

She spends days or weeks in this guise, using her bardic abilities to gain their trust and her roguish skills to learn their plans and weaknesses.",
                "Phase 2 (The Betrayal): At the most critical moment, she strikes. She uses her action to cast a Quickened 'Time Stop'. During the stopped time, she casts her most powerful persisted buffs on herself (using Divine Metamagic on her Archivist spells), summons a powerful creature, and lays down a devastating series of magical traps.",
                "Phase 3 (The Reveal): As time resumes, she uses a heightened 'Dominate Monster' (with a DC in the high 40s) on the enemy leader. With the leader under her control and the battlefield already a magical minefield, the fight is over. She has won not with a single spell, but with a perfectly executed story of betrayal."
