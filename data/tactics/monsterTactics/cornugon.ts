Its strategy revolves around battlefield control, using its reach, martial maneuvers, and combat feats to lock down enemies and create advantageous situations for its allies in its righteous war against chaos and tyranny.",

                "The Cornugon's greatest weapon is its 20-foot reach with the spiked chain combined with the Combat Reflexes feat. It should position itself to control as much of the battlefield as possible, making numerous attacks of opportunity against any foe that moves.",
                "Its Warblade maneuvers are its bread and butter. It should use boosts like 'Leading the Attack' to aid allies, stances like 'Thicket of Blades' to enhance its control, and strikes like 'Iron Heart Surge' to shrug off debilitating effects.",
                "The 'Infernal Wound' ability is a potent debuff, draining Constitution every round. The Cornugon should try to wound as many enemies as possible and then let the drain do its work.",
                "Its spell-like abilities, while not as flashy as a Balor's, are excellent for utility and control. 'Persistent Image' can be used to create illusory terrain or flanking partners."

                "It is a general, not a berserker. It should be played with cunning, using its maneuvers and abilities to dismantle the enemy's strategy before closing for the kill."

                "As an Adamantine Hurricane, its 'Whirlwind of Iron' ability, combined with its 20-foot reach, allows it to attack every enemy in a massive area, inflicting its Infernal Wound on all of them.",
                "The Unbreakable Law is a being of absolute order. Its maneuvers are no longer just attacks, but physical expressions of fundamental laws. Its 'Strike of Perfect Law' can permanently turn a foe into a mindless automaton, a fate worse than death for a creature of chaos. It should be played as the ultimate judge, its every action precise, deliberate, and final."

                "The Cornugon enters the 'Thicket of Blades' stance, which allows it to make an attack of opportunity against any creature that moves within its threatened area, not just out of it. With a 20-foot reach, this is a massive area.",
                "It then uses a maneuver like 'Manticore's Sting' to make a ranged attack with its chain, potentially striking a foe from 40 feet away and drawing them into its threatened area. As soon as the foe moves, it is subject to a flurry of attacks of opportunity.",
                "Example (Level 10 Centurion): It sees a wizard 40 feet away. It initiates 'Manticore's Sting', making a ranged attack. On a hit, the wizard is damaged and now inside the Cornugon's 20-foot threatened area. The Cornugon is in the 'Thicket of Blades' stance. If the wizard tries to cast defensively, the Cornugon gets an AoO. If they try to move away, they get another AoO. This combo can lock down and kill dangerous, mobile enemies before they can act."
