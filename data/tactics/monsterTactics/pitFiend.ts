It combines a fearsome melee presence with a host of powerful spell-like abilities to dominate the battlefield. As a dissident, it fights not for Hell, but for its own vision of perfect, unbreakable order.",

It then uses its 'Knight's Challenge' on the party's main fighter, forcing the warrior to either attack it (and leave the casters unprotected) or suffer penalties.",
                "On its next turn, it unleashes a 'Hellfire Blast'. This is a ranged touch attack, so it's very likely to hit the lightly-armored casters. It will accept the Constitution burn to add the maximum hellfire damage.",
                "Example (Level 10 Hellfire Commander): It teleports next to the wizard. It uses Knight's Challenge on the charging paladin. The wizard, now threatened, tries to cast defensively or move away. The Pit Fiend gets an attack of opportunity. On its turn, it unleashes a Hellfire Blast dealing 8d6 fire + 10d6 hellfire damage (average 63 damage) on the wizard, likely killing them. The paladin is forced to charge the Pit Fiend, who is now free to engage the party's main damage dealer on its own terms."
