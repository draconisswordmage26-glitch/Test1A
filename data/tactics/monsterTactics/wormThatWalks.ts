    description: "The Worm that Walks is a unique and terrifying opponent. It combines the invulnerability of a swarm with the magical power of a high-level spellcaster. Its tactics should be alien and unsettling, focusing on its powerful spellcasting while its physical form makes it immune to most conventional attacks. It fights not for malice, but for the cold, logical pursuit of knowledge.",

                "The Worm's greatest defense is its Swarm Traits. It is immune to all weapon damage. This means that fighters, rogues, and archers are almost useless against it. The party will need area-of-effect spells or effects to harm it.",
                "It is a full-progression spellcaster, starting as a 16th-level wizard. Its spell list is its primary weapon. It should use its immunity to physical attacks to position itself perfectly to unleash its most powerful spells.",
                "Its swarm attack causes distraction (nausea) and poison. It should move to engulf enemy spellcasters to disrupt their concentration.",
                "Its high Spell Resistance and Damage Reduction make it very resilient even to the magical attacks that can harm it."

                "Its Wizard levels grant it access to more spells and bonus feats. It should use these to further enhance its spellcasting prowess.",
                "A good tactic is to cast a persistent area-of-effect spell like 'Cloudkill' or 'Acid Fog' and then move its swarm into the middle of it. The swarm is immune, but its enemies will be trapped and taking damage."

It should be played as a being of pure, dispassionate intellect, a living library of all magical knowledge whose final secret is the one that can unmake reality itself. It stands as a silent, eternal guardian of that terrible knowledge."

                "From this safe position, it can unleash its full magical arsenal with impunity. It should start with battlefield control to make it even harder for the players to reach it, such as 'Solid Fog' or 'Wall of Force'.",
                "Once the battlefield is locked down, it can methodically destroy its enemies with spells that target their weakest saves. It can use 'Feeblemind' on enemy casters, 'Flesh to Stone' on nimble rogues, and 'Disintegrate' on heavily armored fighters.",
                "Example (Level 10 Hive Mind): The Worm floats 30 feet in the air. The party fighter and rogue can't reach it or harm it. It casts a 'Solid Fog' on the ground, obscuring vision and slowing movement. It then uses its Incantatrix abilities to cast a quickened, maximized 'Magic Missile' (dealing a guaranteed 25 damage) at the enemy wizard to disrupt their casting, followed by a 'Finger of Death' (DC 30+ Fort save or die) on the cleric. It is a slow, methodical, and nearly risk-free way to achieve total party kill."
