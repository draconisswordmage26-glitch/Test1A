    description: "The Balor is a high-level general, a being of immense power and surprising tactical flexibility. It is not a mere brute. It combines overwhelming melee power, a host of potent spell-like abilities, and high mobility to control the battlefield and eliminate threats with ruthless efficiency. As a fallen angel fighting a secret war, it uses its demonic form as a disguise, wielding hellfire as a tool of righteous, if terrifying, justice against the chaos of the Abyss.",

                "The Balor's greatest asset is its at-will 'Greater Teleport' which can be quickened. It should use this constantly to maintain optimal positioning, escape dangerous situations, and bypass enemy front lines to strike at vulnerable spellcasters.",
                "Its spell-like abilities are devastating. 'Blasphemy', 'Power Word Stun', and 'Dominate Monster' can each take a powerful foe out of the fight instantly. It should lead with these against the most threatening opponents.",
                "In melee, it is a terror. The flaming whip can entangle foes from a distance, pulling them into range of its 'Vorpal' greatsword. Rage should be used when it commits to a melee engagement for maximum damage.",
                "The 'Death Throes' explosion makes it dangerous even in defeat. A smart Balor might teleport into a group of enemies and allow itself to be killed to take them all out."

                "Its physical attacks are already powerful enough to one-shot many characters. Focus on isolating a target, raging, and destroying them with a full attack."

                "A favorite tactic is to teleport above the battlefield, unleash a 'Blasphemy' or 'Fire Storm', and then teleport away before the enemy can react."

                "As a Demonic Lord, it can grant spells and has its own Abyssal layer. It should be played as a mastermind, using its followers and control over its environment to trap and destroy its foes.",
                "The Unmaker has embraced its role as a necessary evil. Its 'Apocalyptic Rage' can shatter landscapes, and it fights to bring a final, silent end to the chaos of the Abyss. It is a figure of tragic, cosmic power, a weapon that may have to be destroyed once its war is won."

                "This combo leverages the Balor's unparalleled mobility and action economy. The ideal opening is to win initiative and act before the enemy spellcasters can raise their defenses.",
                "The Balor uses its quickened 'Greater Teleport' to appear directly adjacent to the most dangerous enemy caster (e.g., a wizard or cleric). As its standard action, it uses a spell-like ability like 'Power Word Stun' or 'Insanity' (Will save DC 29 at level 10) to neutralize the target.",
                "It can then use its move action to position itself, or if it has another swift action available, teleport again to a safer location or to menace another target. This allows it to neutralize a key threat on round one before the fight has even properly begun.",
                "Example (Level 20 Lord of the Balefire): The Balor wins initiative. It uses a quickened Greater Teleport to appear next to the party's cleric. It uses its standard action to cast 'Dominate Monster' (Will DC 32). The cleric, likely with a lower Will save than the party wizard, is now a powerful ally. It then makes a full attack against the now-surprised wizard, its Vorpal sword a terrifying threat."
