It combines potent Sorcerer spellcasting with the endless possibilities of Wild Shape, making it a true 'toolbox' monster. It fights not for conquest, but for knowledge, seeking to master all of life's forms to achieve a perfect, transcendent state.",

                "If the party is composed of powerful melee combatants, it assumes the form of a creature with high DR and powerful natural attacks, like a Balor. It can then use its own Sorcerer spells to augment this form, casting a quickened 'Greater Invisibility' on itself while it tears into the enemy.",
                "Example (Level 20 The All-Beast): The Maharaja is facing a high-level Paladin. It knows the Paladin's Smite Evil is a major threat. It uses its 'Outsider Wild Shape' ability to assume the form of a good-aligned Adityan Agathion. It is now immune to the Paladin's smite. It can then use its own 17th-level Sorcerer casting to bombard the Paladin with spells like 'Disintegrate' or 'Finger of Death', all while being in a form the Paladin is reluctant to attack. This is the essence of the Maharaja: using its perfect knowledge of forms to always have the perfect counter."
