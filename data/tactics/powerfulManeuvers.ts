      title: "Strike at the Heart of the World (Stone Dragon 18)",
      content: [
        "The ultimate single-target damage ability. This strike deals an extra 100d6 damage, which is enough to threaten even epic-level creatures. Against objects, it can sunder artifacts. The most potent part is the save-or-die effect: on a failed Fortitude save, the target is turned to stone and then crumbles to dust, bypassing regeneration and other defenses. This is the final answer to a single, overwhelmingly powerful foe."

      title: "Moment of Alacrity (White Raven 17)",
      content: [
        "The ultimate action economy boost. As a swift action, this maneuver grants the initiator three additional standard actions. This is an incredible force multiplier, allowing a character to unleash a devastating combination of attacks, spells, or other abilities in a single round. An initiator could use it to cast three powerful spells, make three full attacks (if they have a way to do so as a standard action), or a mix of both. This maneuver can single-handedly turn the tide of a battle."

      title: "Strike of Timeless Mind (Diamond Mind 17)",
      content: [
        "The ultimate single-target lockdown. This attack combines several incredible effects: it automatically hits, it is automatically a critical threat, and it subjects the target to a 'Temporal Stasis' spell with no saving throw. Taking a creature out of the fight permanently with no save is one of the most powerful effects in the game. This should be reserved for the single most dangerous enemy on the battlefield, neutralizing them completely so the rest of the party can deal with other threats."

    {
      title: "Stance of the God-Slayer (Iron Heart 15)",
      content: [
        "The ultimate defensive bypass. While in this stance, all of the initiator's attacks ignore all forms of damage reduction, hardness, and regeneration, even that of deities. Against creatures that rely on high DR or regeneration to survive (like the Verdant Prince or a high-level Barbarian), this stance is an absolute necessity. It turns a long, grinding fight of attrition into a swift execution."

    {
      title: "Tsunami Throw (Setting Sun 18)",
      content: [
        "The ultimate battlefield control maneuver for a martial character. The ability to grab every adjacent enemy and hurl them a thousand feet away is unparalleled. It can be used to clear a space around a vulnerable ally, throw an entire enemy front line off a cliff, or simply to deal massive falling damage and stun a group of foes. It is the perfect tool for breaking up a tight enemy formation."

      title: "Heart of the Volcano (Desert Wind 18)",
      content: [
        "The martial artist's answer to 'Meteor Swarm'. This is a massive area-of-effect nuke that deals a staggering 60d6 damage in a one-mile radius. It's a tool for destroying armies and reshaping landscapes. A high-level Desert Wind master is a walking weapon of mass destruction, and this maneuver is their ultimate weapon."

      title: "Final Death Blow (Tiger Claw 18)",
      content: [
        "The perfect 'execute' ability. Many epic foes have massive pools of hit points, and a fight can become a long grind. This strike allows a Tiger Claw master to bypass that grind, forcing a save-or-die on any creature with 150 HP or less. It's the perfect tool for finishing off a wounded titan or a regenerating troll that just won't stay down."

      title: "Heart of the Nightmare (Shadow Hand 18)",
      content: [
        "The martial version of the 'Weird' spell. This is a powerful area-of-effect save-or-die that targets Will. For a martial character to have access to a tool that can potentially kill an entire group of enemies who fail two saving throws is incredibly potent. It's the perfect way for a Shadow Hand master to deal with crowds of powerful but low-Will brutes."

      title: "The Final Order (White Raven 18)",
      content: [
        "The ultimate party buff. Granting every ally on the entire plane a 'Wish' spell is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful support abilities in the game. This is a campaign-ending maneuver, the final command given by a legendary general at the climax of a cosmic war. The combined power of a half-dozen Wish spells going off at once can solve almost any problem."
